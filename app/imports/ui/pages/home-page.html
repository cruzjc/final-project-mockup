<template name="Home_Page">
  <div class="ui middle aligned centered grid text container">
      <p>views calender showing all subscribed events. will be able to filter between events going to and events that
        are only subscribed(not necessarily going to). (maybe able to create two google calenders in users account, one for
      all subscribed events and the other for more certain events. will require google calenders api for calender manipulation).</p>
    <p>information about current subscriptions,preferences, events attending can be stored on meteor</p>
    <p>header notes. all links can be smooshed into a single button for mobile purposes.</p>
    <p>was thinking the login\landing can be a popup overlay window on the home page</p>
